## Budget

## PyQt5

Many people do not know how to properly allocate their money, which causes problems. My window application will help
you with this. That is, you can enter the amount that is available to you for a month with deduction of forced expenses, depending on
this amount, the amount will be calculated, which will be the average per day. There will also be a calendar available in which you can
enter some purchases on this day, and then calculate whether you have met the average amount per day, later you can view
these purchases!
